# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The
company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. When people
fill up the form on website redirected from search engines providing their email address or
phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through
past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making
calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do
not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.

We need to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that
the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with
lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has given a ballpark of the target
lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
